## About

This is the *fame3* program. It attempts to predict sites of metabolism (SOMs)
for the supplied chemical compounds. It is based on extra trees classifier trained 
for prediction of both phase I and phase II SOMs from the MetaQSAR database [1]. It contains 
a combined phase I and phase II (P1+P2) 
model and separate phase I (P1) and phase II (P2) models. For more details 
on the FAME 3 method, see the FAME 3 publication [2].
